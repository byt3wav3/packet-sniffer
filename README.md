# Packet Sniffer Tool

This is a basic packet sniffer I put together to capture and analyze network traffic.  
Currently supports capturing TCP and UDP packets with filtering options.

## Features
- Live packet capture
- Simple filtering by port and protocol
- Packet summary logs

Check out the usage examples and test files in the repo.  
For more info, see `pipeline.txt` â€” it contains some notes about upcoming features.

*Happy sniffing!*
